# Simple RAG using local models

This RAG creates a vector database from Goethes Faust (english) and asks the question "What is the poodles real core?".

Needs a folder docs with Goethes Faust as goethe_faust_en.txt (e.g. https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14591.txt.utf-8)

CUDA should be available on the machine.

To create the database again, just delete the data folder.
